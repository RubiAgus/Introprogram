I don't know why it was a good idea to add a readme, such a simple checkbox 
for people who actually want to share their code, not some weird 20 year old 
who's doing college homework. 
Anyways, here goes for future me: You  are a great person, I hope wherever you are in life you are working towards a better tomorrow. At the moment I am going through my first semester of college. If you are still Dating Veronica please make sure to take care of her. If you are not, remember the good times, you deserve it.

I hope you are working in software, making more money and spending it on the people you love.
